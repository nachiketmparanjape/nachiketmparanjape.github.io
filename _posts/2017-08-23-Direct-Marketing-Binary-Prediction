# Introduction

  Telemarketing is a method of marketing where a person solicits its prospective customers to buy a particular a product or a service over the phone, during face-to-face conversation, or via online conversation (chat / web-conferencing). While it is an effective marketing tool for certain use cases, it is probably the slowest and most expensive, as it involves company employee/s manually contacting prospective consumers. Hence, whenever a marketing campaign chooses the method of telemarketing, it makes sense if we try to maximize positive outcome by predicting the prospective-consumer behaviour using available data.
  
  In this particular case, we study a Portuguese Bankâ€™s telemarketing campaign for a term-deposit which ran on its existing customers from May 2008 to November 2010. Economic data for the customers is available to a bank. If we combine it with the social indicators and history of the customers with similar campaigns, we can effectively use it for our purpose. There is a potential to gain insights that can greatly help multitudes of decisions that need to be made in designing such a campaign.
  
  I intend to solve this problem and predict whether a particular Campaign will be successful to a customer with particular socio-economic attributes or not. Along with the primary goal of binary classification, we can find secondary qualitative insights about specific sections of societies that might respond to a specific type of marketing technique or a specific product.
