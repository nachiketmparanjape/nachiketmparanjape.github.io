# Introduction

  We all are familiar with the concept of [Telemarketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemarketing). While it is an effective marketing tool for certain use cases, it is probably the slowest and most expensive in terms of outreach, as it involves company employee(s) manually contacting prospective consumers.
  
  Hence, whenever a marketing campaign chooses this method, it makes sense if we try to maximize positive outcome by predicting the prospective-consumer behaviour using available data. In this particular case, I use a dataset[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing] from UCI's rich machine learning repository to predict consumer behaviour for a telemarketing campaign carried out for a term deposit. The dataset is rich with variety of financial, socio-economic as well as consumer history data.
  
  Along with the primary goal of binary classification, we explore secondary qualitative insights about specific sections of societies that might respond to a specific type of marketing technique or a specific product. Let's start!
